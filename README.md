# crypto_monitor
- input upto 1000 different cryptos and monitor their prices, percent change in 24hours, percent change in 7 days
- creates a csv file with the data in your system
- creates a new updated file every *whatever time you want* seconds (you can alter the code)
- creates as many files as you want (also by altering)
- it will look something like *check cryimg.png*
- and yeah, it wont work without the api key, so make sure to get that (you can message me for my api key as well)


## still many improvements to make
